## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: üöÄ Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd [repo-name]
   ```

2. Deploy the application:
   - Use platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any static hosting service
   - Point the deployment to the `public` directory
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for WebRTC)

---

### Step 2: üõ†Ô∏è LLM Agent Setup

The `docs` folder contains all necessary JSON schemas for Flowise AI chatflows and tools configuration. For detailed setup instructions:
- Follow the REX-A and REX-D video guides for database integration and analytics setup
- Check Leon Van Zyl's tutorials for Flowise AI configuration
- Import the provided JSON schemas from the `docs` folder into your Flowise AI instance

Update the Flowise AI configurations in `index.html`:
```javascript
const chatflowId = 'your-chatflow-id';  // Replace with your Flowise AI chatflow ID
const baseUrl = 'your-flowise-url';     // Replace with your Flowise AI API endpoint
```

Note: Search for "flowise", "baseUrl", or "chatflowId" in the code and JSON schemas to locate all places requiring updates.

---

### Step 3: üñ•Ô∏è FastAPI Backend Setup

1. Deploy the FastAPI servers:

   a. Ephemeral Key Server:
   - Repository: [FastAPI Ephemeral Key Server](https://github.com/amararun/shared-openai-realtime-fastapi-ephemeral)
   - Clone and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/amararun/shared-openai-realtime-fastapi-ephemeral
     cd shared-openai-realtime-fastapi-ephemeral
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   b. Cricket Data Server:
   - Repository: [Cricket FastAPI Server](https://github.com/amararun/shared-rexc-cricket-fastapi)
   - Deploy on Render, Railway, or AWS Lambda
   - Follow the deployment instructions in the repo

2. Update the API endpoints in your application configuration.

---

### Step 4: üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup and Data Loading

1. **Set Up Database**:
   - Use any PostgreSQL database (example uses Aiven)
   - Follow the REX-A video guide for Aiven setup
   - Configure database credentials in FastAPI server environment variables

2. **Load Initial Data**:
   - Download `odi.txt` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VHD9UzeYaJF_dBPecnjucHpoGocf4IvR)
   - Upload using one of these methods:
     - rex.tigzig.com (using your database credentials)
     - Python/JavaScript scripts
     - DBeaver or similar tools

3. **Update Data (Optional)**:
   - Current data is as of 6th Dec 2024
   - For newer data:
     1. Download latest ZIP from [Cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org/downloads/#experimental)
     2. Process the ZIP file:
        - Use [Cricket Data Processor](https://github.com/amararun/shared-cricket-data-flask)
        - Or visit rex.tigzig.com -> Automation for AI Apps -> Cricsheet.org CSV-ZIP File Processor

### Step 5: üîê Security Configuration

Adding security to your app is **critical**, especially for API endpoints. Here are a few approaches:
- **API Keys**
- **IP Whitelisting**
- **Authentication**
- **Backend-Frontend Segregation** (requires a separate build)

For this app, I implemented **IP-Domain Whitelisting** for my domain `tigzig.com`:

#### Implementations:
- **Flowise AI Agent**:  
  `Configuration -> Allowed Domain -> Add your domain.`  

- **FastAPI Servers**:  
  Added the domain to the **CORS middleware configuration**.  
  *(Details available in the repo)*  

‚ö° **Tip**: Do this **last**, once everything else is up and running. Debugging becomes easier.

---

### Step 6: üéôÔ∏è Voice Settings Configuration

The application includes configurable Voice Activity Detection (VAD) settings:

- **Threshold**: Sensitivity of voice detection (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Prefix Padding**: Buffer time before voice activity (ms)
- **Silence Duration**: Time before considering speech ended (ms)

Access these settings through the settings button in the UI.

---

## Usage Guide

### Voice Interaction
1. Click the "Connect" button to start a session
2. Allow microphone access when prompted
3. Speak naturally - the VAD system will detect voice activity
4. Adjust VAD settings if needed through the settings panel

### Text Chat
1. Use the text input field for typing messages
2. Press Enter or click Send to submit
3. Switch between voice and text modes as needed

### Charts and Documents
1. Use the tab navigation to switch between chat, charts, and documents
2. Charts are automatically generated based on your requests to the LLM agent, which queries the backend database
3. Documents can be viewed and edited through the integrated viewer

---

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled
   - Check browser microphone permissions
   - Verify WebRTC compatibility

2. **Voice Detection Problems**
   - Adjust VAD settings in the configuration panel
   - Check microphone input levels
   - Ensure proper audio device selection

3. **Backend Connection Errors**
   - Verify API endpoints are correct
   - Check network connectivity
   - Confirm server status
